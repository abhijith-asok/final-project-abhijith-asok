This project looks at the possibility of predicting the readmission status of a patient into a hospital in advance, when the patient spent time at a US hospital for the treatment of diabetes or a related disease.

The **data file** used for this project is the **diabetes_data.csv** in the same repo. For reproducibility, download the file into your local system and change the path in the code or load it directly from this github repo using the 'RCurl' package. 

The **data dictionary** is present in this link : https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/. In addition, the level descriptions of "admission_type_id", "discharge_disposition_id" and "admission_source_id" can be found in the file **IDs_mapping.csv** in this repo.

The entire project including descriptions, code and plots is contained in a single *.Rmd* R Markdown document named **Project document.Rmd**. It is better viewed as **Project document. html**.
